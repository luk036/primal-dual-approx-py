    The `min_vertex_cover_fast` function performs minimum weighted vertex cover using a primal-dual
    approximation algorithm (without post-processing).

    :param ugraph: ugraph is a NetworkX graph object representing the graph on which the minimum weighted
        vertex cover algorithm will be performed. It contains the nodes and edges of the graph

    :param weight: The `weight` parameter is a mutable mapping that represents the weight of each vertex
        in the graph. It is used to determine the minimum weighted vertex cover. The keys of the mapping are
        the vertices of the graph, and the values are the corresponding weights

    :type weight: MutableMapping

    :param coverset: The `coverset` parameter is an optional set that represents the current vertex
        cover. It is used to keep track of the vertices that are included in the cover. If no coverset is
        provided, a new empty set is created

    :type coverset: Optional[Set]

    :return: The function `min_vertex_cover_fast` returns a tuple containing the vertex cover set and
        the total weight of the vertex cover.

    The `min_maximal_independant_set` function performs minimum weighted maximal independent set using
    primal-dual algorithm.

    :param ugraph: ugraph is an undirected graph represented using the NetworkX library. It represents the
        graph structure and contains the vertices and edges of the graph

    :param weight: The `weight` parameter is a dictionary-like object that assigns a weight to each
        vertex in the graph. The keys of the dictionary represent the vertices, and the values represent
        their corresponding weights

        function

    :type indset: Optional[Set]

    :param dep: The `dep` parameter is a set that represents the dependent vertices in the graph. These
        are the vertices that are not included in the independent set and are adjacent to vertices in the
        independent set. The `coverset` function is used to add a vertex and its adjacent vertices to the
        dependent set

    :type dep: Optional[Set]

    :return: The function `min_maximal_independant_set` returns a tuple containing the minimum weighted
        maximal independent set (indset) and the total primal cost (total_prml_cost).
