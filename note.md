# Primal-dual Paradigm

## Key points

- for large scale **weighted** problems.
- Optimal solution is not required.
- Dual problem is easier to **fix** without sorting
- avoid to construct the dual variable, say $y$

## Our Goal

- Clustering in multi-level circuit partitioning
    - graph -> hypergraph (circuit)
    - vertex cover -> minimum maximal matching

## Algorithms

- randomize algorithms (fast, simple, and concurrent)
- primal-dual (fast and simple)
- greedy algorithm (require sorting)

## Minimum maximal matching

- minimum maximal independent set
- minimum maximal matching

## Minimum odd-cycle cover



- Testing
- Visualization
